# @max-minds/haptic-util

Haptic Util is a utility library for [haptic](https://hap.tc). It is entirely possible to write widgets without this library, however if you use it your code will go from:

- Bloated -> Small
- Complicated -> Simple
- Imperitive -> Declaritive
- Untyped -> Typed
- And so on

So I would highly recommend using haptic util.

## Warning
You can't use a `HapticStore` outside of `App.svelte` when using with `@max-minds/haptic-tepmlate`. I'm not exactly sure why.
